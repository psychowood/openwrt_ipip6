# openwrt_ipip6
Entirely based on the script available as the core-componet of the package 'ds-lite' for Chaos Calmer.
Just the script ipip6.sh should be sufficient, given that it'd be copied to two places where dslite.sh would also be found.
This script is intended for my personal use, so do not ever attempt to ask OpenWrt dev members for supports.
For parts I have quoted, all rights of this script should belong to OpenWrt dev team.
